Codes for modelling epidemics on networks using compartment models (eg SIR) 

Supported compartment model types:

    sir        : susceptible, infected ,            recovered
    seir       : susceptible, exposed  , infected , recovered
    sirs       : susceptible, infected ,            recovered, susceptible 
    
SIR Modelling: 
    
    Deterministic - Numerical solution of nonlinear ode with Euler explicit step with Graph Laplacian, L, providing diffusion of infected class around network.
					Variable diffusivity at edge, or reactivity at vertex not considered.

                     sir model parameters   = x
         d_t (sir compartments on node i )  = f(sir compartments on node i, x)
	 d_t (i compartment for all nodes) += diffusivity*L*(i compartment for all nodes)
