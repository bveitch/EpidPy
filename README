Codes for modelling epidemics using compartment models (eg SIR) and fitting parameters (solving) using nonlinear least squares objective function

Supported compartment model types:

    sir        : susceptible, infected ,            recovered
    seir       : susceptible, exposed  , infected , recovered
    sirs       : susceptible, infected ,            recovered, susceptible 
    si2r       : susceptible, infected1, infected2, recovered
    sir_nstage : susceptible, infected (n stages) , recovered
    
SIR Modelling: 
    
    Deterministic - Numerical solution of nonlinear ode with Euler explicit step

           sir model parameters = x
         d_t (sir compartments) = f(sir compartments , x)
       
SIR solver:
    
    Least squares fitting by finding x which minimizes the objective function 
    
        obj(x) = | W ( S*sir_fx(x) - d ) |_2^2

    with

        x      : model space from sir_modeller.py
        d      : data to fit
        sir_fx : sir compartment model, function from x to sir compartments
        S      : sampling function from sir compartments to space of d
        W      : diagonal matrix - weighting function of time samples
